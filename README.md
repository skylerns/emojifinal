Repository for my "100 emoji" final project.

Files:

main.py - Initial scrape file. Scrapes 1000 tweets containing the emoji and writed them to hunnidscrape.csv

filter.py - Filter file. Contains all filters removing unnecessary tweets, and categorizes tweets into "fact" and "opinion" categories. Also writes these outputs into .csv files.

hunnidscrape.csv - Full, unfiltered scrape output. 1000 tweets.

facts.csv, opinions.csv, and unmarked.csv - output files for the categorization filters.

filteroutput_coding.csv - full annotated list of filtered tweets.
